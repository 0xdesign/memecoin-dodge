## Background and Motivation

This project aims to create an entertaining and engaging web-based 3D game similar to Fortnite but with an educational twist about cryptocurrency markets. Players will navigate a 3D environment while dodging falling rockets that represent memecoins that are currently down in the market. The game will fetch real-time market data for the top 100 memecoins by market cap once during development, providing an interactive way for users to learn about cryptocurrency market trends while having fun.

The game will be mobile-first, ensuring that it's easy to control and experience on an iPhone, making it accessible to a wider audience.

The game now provides a much more engaging and dynamic experience with strategic elements that complement the educational aspect of learning about memecoins that are down in the market.

The current limitation is that we're using mock data instead of live API data due to API connectivity issues, but the game design allows for easy integration of real-time data once the API issues are resolved.

The game is now ready for testing and refinement before final deployment.

I've successfully created a GitHub repository for the project at https://github.com/0xdesign/memecoin-dodge. The repository contains all the necessary files with appropriate .gitignore settings to exclude node_modules, build files, and other unnecessary items. The repository is public and includes a descriptive README.md file that explains the game's concept, features, and development instructions.
